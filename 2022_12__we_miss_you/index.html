              1. Hellow everyone, during the last maker week
              <strong>Jonas Walravens</strong> developer at the Nieuwsblad
              newsroom and I <strong>Robbie Bardijn</strong> Javascript dev at
              team publishing studio focussed ourselves on the We miss you
              challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. We want to help our <strong>readers</strong> in
              <strong>the news apps</strong> with creating
              <strong>a read habit</strong> by our
              <strong>we miss you mail</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.Our <strong>customer journey hook</strong> starts when a reader
              becomes <strong>inactive</strong> after 1 week. We'll send him our
              "We miss you" email as an external trigger accompanied with 2
              small features. We will send Unread articles in the mail for that
              reader and he or she will see how many other readers have read
              these articles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>action</strong> will be the click in the mail and when
              that happens we take the user back to the application, behind the
              screens we'll check if the app is installed.
            </p>
            <p>
              To increase the <strong>tribe feeling</strong> as a reward we'll
              also want to add in a feature in the app that counts all read
              articles for you as a reader. So you'll actually see how many
              articles you have read in the app or on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user will return as investment his Data and Time in the app.
              Then after he becomes inactive again, the hook can start over.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Here you can see a small part of our complete journey. In the
              first screen on the left you see the we miss you mail coming in in
              <strong>jonas his inbox</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second screen holds <strong>the actual mail</strong> with the
              features I showed you in the customer journey hook, you can see
              how many times an article was read right next to the glasses icon.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the user clicks on the article we check if the app is
              installed and if so we open it. And then
              <strong>we show him the article</strong>
              and increase his read articles by one in the upper right corner.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also worked on <strong>a second e mail</strong> we could send
              out the second week a user is inactive. This one holds features
              like
              <strong
                >5 free articles to give away or to spend on your own</strong
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. As cherry on the cake we
              <strong>already gathered some data</strong>. For the
              <strong>Nieuwsblad</strong>
              brand for example we found around 99.000 non actives users for 1
              week. As you can see there really is something to gain here.
              Credits for this data research go to Ruth Verheyen.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Yes, thanks for your time. I've linked up the full presentation
              here as a <strong>tiny url</strong> for you to go check it out if
              you are interested in our idea. <br />
              If you have
              <strong>questions or remarks</strong>
              feel free to ask me or Jonas here or in dm on slack.
