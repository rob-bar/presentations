            <p>
              First of all Thank you <strong>Laure</strong> for having me here
              at this Lunch & Learn Session, and Welcome everyone at our trendy
              workshop vibe coding :)
            </p>
            <p>
              My name is <strong>Robbie</strong> and I am a software engineer
              here at TPS in <strong>team innovation</strong>. Together with
              Heino I follow up on new trends and technologies to cook up some
              interesting and sometimes also pretty challenging pocs.
            </p>
            <p>
              And of course we sometimes vibe code, for example during maker
              weeks. But a small sidenote, I am surely not yet an expert at this
              since is pretty new. But I do want to share with you all, some of
              the things I have learned.
            </p>
            <p>Our agenda for today will look something like this.</p>

                First we'll have a block of about 25 minutes where we'll look at
                the theory: <strong>What is</strong> vibe coding, How dit it
                come to be? Where and how can I use this new methodology. Is
                this going to be the <strong>future of coding?</strong> What
                <strong>tools</strong> are now available to help me with
                building my app. Where can I use it? What are
                <strong>best practices</strong>? and why should I even care
                about it?
              </li>
              <li>[SPACE] Then we'll have a small conversation in the Q&A</li>
              <li>
                [SPACE] To get us starting with the fun part, we'll have a
                hands-on session where you guys and girls can get your hands
                dirty. I've prepared some nice challenges for you to work on to
                try out vibe coding yourself. It's gonna be a lot of fun, I
                promise!
              </li>
              <li>
                Once we are on a roll, I'll demonstrate some of the things here
                on screen in a live demo. I did not really prepare that live
                part, but I guess I want to try out claud.code with you guys and
                maybe we'll build an example.
              </li>
              <li>
                [SPACE] Finally, we'll wrap up this lunch with a short moment to
                reflect upon some key takeaways to take with you on your
                journey. Oh yeah, and of course if you want to share what you've
                built or your experience, feel free to do so.

          "Don't wait for inspiration. Code until it arrives."
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              They say that the most daunting thing when
              <strong>starting something new</strong>
              is the blank canvas. But then you realize that the blank canvas is
              just a canvas. And you just go with the flow and just start, just
              start goddammit.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might fail <strong>miserably</strong> and you start again. You
              try again and again until you get it right. You try
              <strong>different things</strong>, you experiment, you iterate,
              you learn. You learn from your mistakes and you keep on learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same goes for coding. You can sit there and wait for
              inspiration to hit you, but it won't come.

              Vibe coding is a <strong>new way of coding</strong> where you just
              put in <strong>one prompt</strong> and then you can rest a bit in
              your chair and let AI do the work for you. Go grab a
              <strong>coffee</strong>, go chat with one of your
              <strong>beloved colleagues</strong> about your fabulous dreams of
              quitting your job and opening a beach bar that vanish every time
              payroll hits. [PAUSE]
            </p>
            <p>This Sounds great, right? Well, it is. But it's not. [SPACE]</p>
            <p>So seriously what is it?</p>
            <p>
              Vibe coding is a <strong>programming paradigm</strong> dependent
              on artificial intelligence where developers describe what they
              want in natural language and let AI generate the code for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term was introduced and coined by
              <strong>Andrej Karpathy</strong> in February 2025 and was added to
              the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the following month as a "slang &
              trending" noun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some cool projects have already been made. And A good percentage
              of global code is now for some percentage ai generated, weather
              that is a good thing or not is what we'll discover along the way.

              Here is that tweet from Andrej, for those who don't know him yet.

            <p>
              Andrej Karpathy is a
              <strong>prominent computer scientist</strong> and artificial
              intelligence (AI) researcher, best known for his work in
              <strong>deep learning and computer vision</strong>. He has been
              influential in both academic and industry settings. Worked for
              Tesla, worked at OpenAi and is now working on some personal
              projects.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              So yeah, the hottest new programming language is English. Let that
              statement also sink in for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now everyone can code :D or at least
              <strong>ask ai to write code for them</strong>
              and thats fine! It is even <strong>great</strong>, because the
              barrier between coders and non-coders is hereby getting smaller
              and smaller. Means better communication in general and means more
              people can get involved into building software.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>But that needs a little bit more <strong>nuance</strong>.</p>
            <p>
              An experienced coder, will quickly spot potential quirks or might
              stand very strongly against the whole idea of vibe coding.

            <p>
              What if a non technical user gets stuck? What if you have never
              written a single line of code? How do you start? How do you fix
              things?
            </p>
            <p>
              You see the perspective really matters, and the way you should
              handle it depends on your perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Are you a coder? Are you a problem solver? Are you a good
              communicator? Are you a creative mastermind? Are you just leaving
              school and looking for a job? [PAUSE] Well good luck to you with

              <strong>art and a science</strong> that requires ingenuity,
              creativity, and good instincts gained throughout years of
              experience.

              The best programmers often spend more time removing code than
              writing code. And if you don't understand the code you're vibing
              out like a true programmer, you are in for a really wild ride.

            I'm pretty sure that some of you who use ai for coding have already
            experienced this kind of flow where you ask AI to fix your code and
            it actually gets worse and worse. So how do we avoid this? How do we
            set ourselves up for success.

            <p>
              The <strong>first rule</strong> and this rule is the most flexible
              one is to choose the right stack you are building in. And what is
              considered to be the RIGHT stack? Well, for starters your new
              fancy javascript framework is probably going to kill your vibez
              because ai might not have had enough training data to get good at
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              You wanna choose something popular that already exists for a while
              like: React, Svelte or tailwind, express, node, fastApi you name
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of languages choose one of the popular ones, and if you
              are a coder and already know some languages it certainly at your
              advantage to choose something you already know. (duh)
            </p>
            <p>
              [SPACE] The second rule is...Get good at git. Some people in the
              crowd know me as a git nerd because I know all the commands like a
              bit of a freak, but hey I like the terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of
              changes to your code and collaborate with others. It's essential
              for any software development project.
            </p>
            <p>
              When something goes wrong while vibe coding...you can always fall
              back to your latest commit or latest stashed changes.[SPACE]
            </p>
            <p>
              The third rule is to think like a PM. Maybe for the devs among us
              a harder step. But again this depends on your personal skills.
            </p>
            <p>Ask not what can AI do for me? but what can I do for AI?</p>
            <p>You are not a coder anymore...</p>

              And if you wanna be a good one, you need to break down
              <strong>complex requirements into small steps</strong>. They
              should be <strong>highly specific</strong> and also provide the
              <strong>proper context</strong> to solve the problem.

              You want to explain your feature with recent documentation and
              images for UI design. It might sound like a vibe killer, but you
              don't want your LLM to get too creative. You want it to be as
              <strong>deterministic</strong> as possible.

            <p>
              This is a common problem that you might encounter while vibe
              coding. Your agent keeps making the same mistakes over and over
              again.

              I want to be able to tell my agent on every prompt that it needs

            </p>
            <p>
              You can simply solve this by providing your agent with a memory
              and asking it to remember the specific thing you want it to keep
              in mind. Or you can use something like Rules in cursor [SPACE]

              And there is a whole bunch of rules out there. Things you want AI

              coding styles. Or some specific things you want it to do or not

            <p>Should I write tests? Absolutely!</p>
            <p>
              Developers often write tests to test out their code before
              actually using it. It's run in a whole other environment and it is
              isolated from the rest so you should make sure that critical parts
              of your app are tested. Preferably the core of your app.

              Cursor $20/month is a great one, and one might say the

              Visual Studio Code is a <strong>more robust</strong>,
              <strong>more used</strong>

              nice update for about a month old where you can also use agents to
              practically do the same thing you would do in cursor or windsurf.

              Usually they have a built in canvas or deployment system where you

              I recommend non coders today to use these tools, of course

            <p>
              First we have <strong>Firebase.studio</strong> the one that came
              out most recently. This tool is completely free and ready to use.
              It's funny how the google giant just whiped away all the other
              paying tools in one blow.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Bolt.new</strong> is one of the older ones and is really
              great for ui's and frontends. It has a token base pricing.
              Developed by the StackBlitz team. Who do all their coding in the
              cloud.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Lovable</strong> just came out recently with a polished
              2.0 version of their app and it works way better than before.
              Check em out at lovable.dev
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>v0</strong> of vercel and their nextjs. It also came about
              the same time bolt.new got introduces. I myself am not a big
              nextjs fan so I haven't tried this one out yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              And last but not least <strong>replit</strong> another browser
              based ide with ai capabilities. They have diferent plans for
              pricing.

              Then there is <strong>Roo code</strong> which is actually a fork
              of of Cline. Roo code is a free visual code plugin, where you can
              hook up something like openrouter.ai and then choos the models you
              want. What I like about roo code is it's transparancy and all the
              settings they provide. It's really a nice extension to use. While
              vibe coding you know exatly how much money your calls to specifci
              models cost.
            </p>
            <p>Then we have <strong>Avante</strong> for neo vim users.</p>
            <p>
              And last but not least, <strong>Github copilot</strong> which also
              has strongly evolved over the years.
            </p>
            <p>
              I bet that most of the developer remember their first Github
              Copilot auto complete like I do.

              Like <strong>Claude Code</strong> from anthropic, I've heard some
              really great things about claude code. And I'll be testing it out
              soon. Maybe even during this session. We'll see.

              Then Openai has also a cli called Codex Cli, it's rather
              lightweight and I haven't tested that one yet.
