              Hello and Welcome everyone at our trendy workshop vibe coding :)
            </p>
            <p>
              My name is <strong>Robbie</strong> and I am a software engineer
              here at TPS in team innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to share with you some of the things I have learned about
              vibe coding and how I have learned to use it.
            </p>
            <p>Our agenda for today will look something like this.</p>

                So first we'll have a block of about 25 minutes where we'll look
                at the theory: What is vibe coding, How dit it come to be? Where
                and how can I use this new methodology. Is this going to be the
                future of coding? What tools are now available to help me with
                building my app. Where can I use it? What are best practices.
                <strong>and</strong> why should I even care about it?
              </li>
              <li>[SPACE] Then we'll have a small conversation in the Q&A</li>
              <li>
                [SPACE] After that, we'll have a hands-on session where you guys
                can get your hands dirty. I've prepared some small challenges
                for you to work on trying out vibe coding. It's gonna be a lot
                of fun, I promise!
              </li>
              <li>
                Once we are on a roll, I'll demonstrate some of the things here

              <li>
                [SPACE] Finally, we'll wrap up with a short discussion about the
                future of vibe coding and coding in general and I'll give you
                guys some key takeaways to take with you on your journey.

          "Don't wait for inspiration. Code until it arrives."
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              They say that the most daunting thing to start with something new
              it is the blank canvas. But then you realize that the blank canvas
              is just a canvas. And you just go with the flow and just damn
              start.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might fail miserably and you start again. You try again and
              again until you get it right. You try different things, you
              experiment, you iterate, you learn. You learn from your mistakes
              and you keep learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same goes for coding. You can sit there and wait for
              inspiration to hit you, but it won't come. You have to start
              coding, that's when more ideas will come.

              Vibe coding is a new way of coding where you just put in one
              prompt and then you can rest a bit in your chair and let the AI do
              the work for you. Sounds great, right? Well, it is. But it's not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vibe coding is a <strong>programming paradigm</strong> dependent
              on artificial intelligence where developers describe what they
              want in natural language and let AI generate the code for them.
              The term was introduced and coined by Andrej Karpathy in February
              2025 and was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the following
              month as a "slang & trending" noun.

              Here is that tweet from Andrej, for those who don't know him yet.

            <p>
              Andrej Karpathy is a prominent computer scientist and artificial
              intelligence (AI) researcher, best known for his work in deep
              learning and computer vision. He has been influential in both
              academic and industry settings. Worked for Tesla, worked at OpenAi
              and is now working on some personal projects.

              So yeah, the hottest new programming language is English. Let that

            <p>
              An experienced coder, will quickly spot potential quirks or might
              stand very strongly against the whole idea of vibe coding.

            <p>
              You see the perspective really matters, and the way you should
              handle it depends on your perspective.

              Are you a coder? Are you a problem solver? Are you a good

            <p>Back to that question. How can I use this new methodology?</p>
            <p>
              Well there are a couple of things you need to know before you
              begin
            </p>
            <p>
              The first thing you need to realize is that Coding and Programming
              are not the same.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>
            <span style="color: var(--ai-secondary-color)">Coding</span> !=
            <span style="color: var(--ai-tertiary-color)">Programming</span>
          </h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Coding is the skill of
              <strong
                >translating logic into instructions for a computer</strong
              >
              by writing code. An elite coder might be able to bang out a
              hundred words per minute of perfect C code and VIM purely from
              memorized syntax,
              <strong
                >but large language models are making this skill
                obsolete</strong
              >. An eight year old prompter can now write code faster than a
              skilled professional with twenty years of experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              But <strong>programming is a far broader skill</strong> that's
              kinda hard to describe. It's both an
              <strong>art and a science</strong> that requires ingenuity,
              creativity, and good instincts gained throughout years of
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              So something to bear in mind. And that comes back to that
              perspective of which we already looked at.

              The first rule is to choose the right stack you are building in.
              And what is considered to be the RIGHT stack? Well, for starters
              your new fancy javascript framework is probably going to kill your
              vibez because ai might not have had enough training data to get
              good at it.

            <p>
              You wanna choose something popular that already exists for a while
              like: React, Svelte or tailwind, express, node, fastApi you name
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of languages choose one of the popular ones, and if you
              are a coder and already know some languages it certainly at your
              advantage to choose something you already know. (duh)
            </p>
            <p>
              [SPACE] The second rule is...Get good at git. Some people in the
              crowd know me as a git freak because I know all the commands like
              a bit of a freak, but hey I like the terminal. Git is a version
              control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your
              code and collaborate with others. It's essential for any software
              development project.
            </p>
            <p>
              When something goes wrong while vibe coding...you can always fall
              back to your latest commit or latest stashed changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third rule is to think like a PM. Maybe for the devs among us
              a harder step. But again this depends on your personal skills.
