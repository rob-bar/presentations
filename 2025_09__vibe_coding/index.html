            <p>
              First of all Thank you Laure for having me here at this Lunch &
              Learn Session. Hello and Welcome everyone at our trendy workshop
              vibe coding :)
            </p>
            <p>
              My name is <strong>Robbie</strong> and I am a software engineer
              here at TPS in team innovation. Together with Heino I follow up on
              new trends and technologies to cook up some interesting and
              sometimes also pretty challenging pocs.
            </p>
            <p>
              And of course we vibe code. But a small sidenote, I am not surely
              not yet an expert since the methodology is pretty new. But I do
              want to share with you all, some of the things I have learned.
            </p>
            <p>Our agenda for today will look something like this.</p>

                First we'll have a block of about 25 minutes where we'll look at
                the theory: What is vibe coding, How dit it come to be? Where
                and how can I use this new methodology. Is this going to be the
                future of coding? What tools are now available to help me with
                building my app. Where can I use it? What are best practices.
                <strong>and</strong> why should I even care about it?
              </li>
              <li>[SPACE] Then we'll have a small conversation in the Q&A</li>
              <li>
                [SPACE] To get us starting with the fun part, we'll have a
                hands-on session where you guys can get your hands dirty. I've
                prepared some nice challenges for you to work on to try out vibe
                coding yourself. It's gonna be a lot of fun, I promise!
              </li>
              <li>
                Once we are on a roll, I'll demonstrate some of the things here
                on screen in a live demo.

              <li>
                [SPACE] Finally, we'll wrap up this lunch with a short moment to
                reflect upon some key takeaways to take with you on your
                journey. Oh yeah, and of course if you want to share what you've
                built or your experience, feel free to do so.

          "Don't wait for inspiration. Code until it arrives."
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              They say that the most daunting thing when starting something new
              is the blank canvas. But then you realize that the blank canvas is
              just a canvas. And you just go with the flow and just start, just
              start goddammit.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might fail miserably and you start again. You try again and
              again until you get it right. You try different things, you
              experiment, you iterate, you learn. You learn from your mistakes
              and you keep on learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same goes for coding. You can sit there and wait for
              inspiration to hit you, but it won't come. But then you just
              start, that's when more ideas will come.

              Vibe coding is a new way of coding where you just put in one
              prompt and then you can rest a bit in your chair and let AI do the
              work for you. Go grab a coffee, go chat with one of your beloved
              colleagues about your fabulous dreams of quitting your job and
              opening a beach bar that vanish every time payroll hits. [PAUSE]
            </p>
            <p>This Sounds great, right? Well, it is. But it's not. [SPACE]</p>
            <p>
              Vibe coding is a <strong>programming paradigm</strong> dependent
              on artificial intelligence where developers describe what they
              want in natural language and let AI generate the code for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term was introduced and coined by Andrej Karpathy in February
              2025 and was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the following
              month as a "slang & trending" noun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some cool projects have already been made. And A good percentage
              of global code is now already ai generated, weather that is a good
              thing or not is what we'll discover along the way.

              Here is that tweet from Andrej, for those who don't know him yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Andrej Karpathy is a prominent computer scientist and artificial
              intelligence (AI) researcher, best known for his work in deep
              learning and computer vision. He has been influential in both
              academic and industry settings. Worked for Tesla, worked at OpenAi
              and is now working on some personal projects.

            The <span class="color-primary">hottest</span> new programming
            language is <span class="color-primary">English</span>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              So yeah, the hottest new programming language is English. Let that
              statement also sink in for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now everyone can code :D or at least ask ai to write code for them
              and thats fine! It is even great, because the barrier between
              coders and non-coders is hereby getting smaller and smaller. Means
              better communication in general and means more people can get
              involved into building software.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>But that needs a little bit more <strong>nuance</strong>.</p>
            <p>
              An experienced coder, will quickly spot potential quirks or might
              stand very strongly against the whole idea of vibe coding.

            <p>
              What if a non technical user gets stuck? What if you have never
              written a single line of code? How do you start? How do you fix
              things?
            </p>
            <p>
              You see the perspective really matters, and the way you should
              handle it depends on your perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Are you a coder? Are you a problem solver? Are you a good
              communicator? Are you a creative mastermind? Are you just leaving
              school and looking for a job? [PAUSE] Well good luck to you with
              this kind of market.

            I'm pretty sure that some of you who use ai for coding have already
            experienced this kind of flow where you ask AI to fix your code and
            it actually gets worse and worse. So how do we avoid this? How do we
            set ourselves up for success.

              Are there any rules you can apply? <strong>Yes there are</strong>,
              there are even some techniques like the CREATE technique on how to
              write good prompts. Remember that one?

            <ul>
              <li>C for Contextualise or set up a Character,</li>
              <li>R for the Request,</li>
              <li>E for Elaboration or showing Examples,</li>
              <li>A for Include Authenticity or small Adjustments,</li>
              <li>
                T to Make some Transformation or change the Type of the output
              </li>
              <li>and E for some extras.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              First lets define some rules, then we'll go a little bit deeper
              with the techniques.

          </ol>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              The first rule and this rule is the most flexible one is to choose
              the right stack you are building in. And what is considered to be
              the RIGHT stack? Well, for starters your new fancy javascript
              framework is probably going to kill your vibez because ai might
              not have had enough training data to get good at it.
            </p>
            <p>
              You wanna choose something popular that already exists for a while
              like: React, Svelte or tailwind, express, node, fastApi you name
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of languages choose one of the popular ones, and if you
              are a coder and already know some languages it certainly at your
              advantage to choose something you already know. (duh)
            </p>
            <p>
              [SPACE] The second rule is...Get good at git. Some people in the
              crowd know me as a git nerd because I know all the commands like a
              bit of a freak, but hey I like the terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of
              changes to your code and collaborate with others. It's essential
              for any software development project.
            </p>
            <p>
              When something goes wrong while vibe coding...you can always fall
              back to your latest commit or latest stashed changes.[SPACE]
            </p>
            <p>
              The third rule is to think like a PM. Maybe for the devs among us
              a harder step. But again this depends on your personal skills.
            </p>
            <p>Ask not what can AI do for me? but what can I do for AI?</p>
            <p>You are not a coder anymore...</p>

            <p>You are now a product manager.</p>
            <p>
              And if you wanna be a good one, you need to break down complex
              requirements into small steps. They should be highly specific and
              also provide the proper context to solve the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              You want to give it things like recent documentation and images
              for UI design. It might sound like a vibe killer, but you don't
              want your LLM to get too creative. You want it to be as
              deterministic as possible.
